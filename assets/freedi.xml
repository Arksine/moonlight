            <title>[Announcement] Warning about a fundamental issue on FreeDi</title>
            <link>https://github.com/Phil1988/FreeDi/issues/290</link>
            <description>Hello everyone!

There are currently a few reports about affected X3 series owners with freezing systems mid print.
(See here https://github.com/Phil1988/FreeDi/issues/288).

I didnt had that problem on my tests before releasing v2.00 on my X-Max3 - but there definetly is "something" not working for some users.
Unfortunately I am gone for a while (see https://github.com/Phil1988/FreeDi/issues/283) and I cant track this down.

For now, I can only give all of you a warning:
**Do not update or install FreeD...</description>

            <title>FreeDi v2.00</title>
            <link>https://github.com/Phil1988/FreeDi/issues/253</link>
            <description>## ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads-up: Upgrading FreeDi from **v1.x ‚ûú v2.00**
  
A quick notice before the v2.00 release drops later today:

### Why this notice?
Moving from the 1.x line to **v2.00** brings a completely new software base (Armbian 25, Klipper 0.13, fresh screen firmwares, reworked configs, the Wizard, and much more ‚Ä¶).  
Although I‚Äôve run several upgrade tests successfully, I **cannot guarantee** a flawless transition on every device.
This major release can cause problems on a normal update.

### üîí Please back ...</description>
