            <link>https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker/issues/516</link>
            <description>An upcoming addition to Moonraker will change how files and folders are configured and managed in Moonraker.  All folders and files managed by Moonraker will be contained within a `data path` configured in the command line.  Options such as `config_path` and `log_path`, `secrets_path`, etc. will be deprecated.</description>

            <title>Changes to include behavior</title>
            <link>https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker/issues/473</link>
            <description>The behavior of Moonraker's include directives has changed.  Include directives are now parsed in place as if the included file were copied into its parent.  This is how Klipper and other applications handle include directives.</description>
